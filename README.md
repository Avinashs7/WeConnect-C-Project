# WeConnect-C-Project
C Project attempts to predict crop for cultivation based on the factors like NPK and various other and even geometrical location which benefits the farmers and society. Currently it is implemented by linked list sorting and matching with the heuristics (here it is dummy dataset). It takes feedback to refine the prediction and also takes in the solution from the farmer which they have come across. 

Working to implement instance based model to encompass a huge set of data and make smart farming an emerging trend and also to spread awareness about organic framing to increase soil fertility.
